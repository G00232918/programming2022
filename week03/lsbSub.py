# Program to subtract one number from another

# input reads as string so the we need to convert into int
# so we can perform mathematical operations

# mathematical process, you usually use x and y

# define the inputs

x = int (input("input first number:"))
y = int (input("input second number"))
answer= x-y
print ("{} minus {} is {} ".format(x , y , answer))
